This is the intial release of the Secwepemc spellchecking dictionary for
hunspell.  The Makefile is used to install it while I work on the debian
packaging.

I still haven't formally cleared the copyright with the wordlist with the
people who originally created it.  That being the Secwepemc Cultural Education
Society.

I used the script here to convert the aspell wordlist

Into the starting of the .aff and .dic files.

Stay tuned for a full release and OpenOffice and Mozilla Extensions.
